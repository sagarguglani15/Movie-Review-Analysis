Heya!
	In this projects, I have tried to collect some review/comments data from IMDB to analyze the sentiments of viewers for/against a 		movie.
	
IMPORTS:
	1. GOOGLE SEARCH:    This helps to search some query on google search engine and results in the resulted links in desired order.
	2. URL-LIB: 	     This library generates a request to load the contents of a web page from url obtained( here from the above 				google search results)
	3. Beautiful-Soup:   The library acts on the response of URLLIB.REQUEST and reads the web content
	4. NLTK:	     This is an ML library that breaks the content of the web-page into a list of sentences (sentence tokenize)
	5. TextBlob:	     This AI library helps to understand positive and negative sentiments behind some text input.
				  like:- The story and plot was amazing.     : A positive review ( polarity > 0 )
				         An awful movie.		     : A negative review ( polarity < 0 )
				         The movie has 4 songs.		     : A neutral review  ( polarity = 0 )

	6. Pandas: 	     To set the results into a DataFrame.
	7. MatPlotLib: 	     To represent the result graphicaly. ( Used PIE chart and Scatter graph. )
	8. FigureCanvasTkagg:To plot the graph on Tkinter GUI Window.

Go through the code. And run on any PYTHON3 IDE/Console
